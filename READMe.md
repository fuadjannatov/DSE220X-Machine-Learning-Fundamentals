## UCSanDiegoX: DSE220x : Machine Learning Fundamentals 
#### Course Instructor: Sanjoy Dasgupta, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, UC San Diego

### Learning Objectives
This course is an intensive introduction to the most widely-used machine learning methods:

> The first goal is to provide a basic intuitive understanding of these techniques: what they are good for, how they work, how they relate to one another, and their strengths and weaknesses.
> 
> The second goal is to provide a hands-on feel for these methods through experiments with suitable data sets, using Jupyter notebooks.
> 
>The third goal is to understand machine learning methods at a deeper level by delving into their mathematical underpinnings. This is crucial to being able to adapt and modify existing methods and to creatively combining them.



### This course provides a thorough grounding in a wide range of machine learning methods, for classification, regression, conditional probability estimation, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
1. Taxonomy of prediction problems
2. Nearest neighbor methods and families of distance functions
3. Generalization: what it means; overfitting; selecting parameters using cross-validation
